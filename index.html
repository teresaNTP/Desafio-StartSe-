              <h1>London</h1>
              <h2>Discovery London</h2>
              <p>
                London is one of the most popular cities in the world. It’s home to charming pubs, world-class (and often free) museums, tons of history, some of the best theater in the world, a diverse population, incredible food, and a wild nightlife.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>Vibrant, modern, elegant, busy, rich in culture and entertainment options. Features like these, among many others, make it clear why London is one of the most sought after destinations in the world. The capital of England and the United Kingdom is also the seat of the British monarchy, a city that is home to Big Ben and many other famous postcards, such as the Tower of London Bridge, which is on the banks of the River Thames; Buckingham Palace; Westminster Abbey, as well as several very interesting museums.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The official language is English and the tourist who masters this "universal language" will have no difficulty, even if the elegant British accent is a little difficult to understand at first. However, like any self-respecting cosmopolitan city, London brings together people from all over the world; including a huge amount of Brazilians, locals or just tourists. The local currency is the pound sterling (Pound sterling), considered one of the strongest economically (beating the dollar and the euro). And even if at first glance everything seems too expensive, know that it is possible to haggle and find good deals.</p>

The Olympic Games were also born there and were held in the city of Olympia in 776 BC. It was in Ancient Greece, in the Classical Period, that the Greeks cultivated beauty, architecture, democracy and sculptures.
